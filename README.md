# RECOLLECT

This repository contains an implementation of the RECOLLECT architecture as described in:

A.R. van den Berg, P. R. Roelfsema & S. M. Bohte (2023). [Biologically plausible gated recurrent neural networks for working memory and learning-to-learn.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.06.547911v1.article-metrics) Biorxiv.

## Dependencies
* Python (tested on 3.8.0)
* Numpy (tested on 1.23.1)
* Pandas (tested on 1.2.3)
* Matplotlib (tested on 3.3.4, but not required to run the code)

## Using RECOLLECT
An example of how to use RECOLLECT has been provided for the pro-/anti-saccade task from Gottlieb and Goldberg (1999).
